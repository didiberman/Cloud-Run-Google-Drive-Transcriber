Hey Sam! 👋 needed 2 things from you to set up the automation:

**1. Gmail App Password** (so the script can email you alerts)
1. Go to `myaccount.google.com/security`.
2. Ensure **2-Step Verification** is ON.
3. Search for **"App passwords"**.
4. Create new -> Name it "Drive Bot".
5. Copy the 16-character code and send it to me.

**2. Share the Folder** (so the bot can see videos)
1. Go to your Drive folder.
2. Share with: `drive-bot@didiberman.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Set as **Viewer**.

That's it! 🚀
